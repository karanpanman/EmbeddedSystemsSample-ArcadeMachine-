Hello, I'm Karan! This is code all written 100% by me for an embedded systems project I really love! I made it as a dedication to my love for gaming, specifically my nostalgia for the old arcade days! I was inspired to use an Arduino embedded system (programmed entirely in C++), in which I could use a Joystick, LED Matrix, and LED Display, along with a couple of buttons, to truly recreate the experience of playing games at an arcade.

There are plenty of screenshots of state machine drawings within the folder, all of which demonstate my planning process, in terms of how I would set up the games along with the main menu. I'd also like to apologize for my real meessy handwriting! However, the planning I did on paper for the state machines is treally reflected in the C++ code I wrote for the Stacker and Snake games! Please go into the folder "Stacker and Snake" and click on the 
.ino file also called "Stacker and Snake.ino" as this contains the entirety of the C++ code! This project took lots of time and debugging, but I really felt that I had grown as a programmer from it, along with also having an end-result project that I really loved playing with! I recorded a YouTube video for this too back when I had first assembled it all, so please take a look!

If there's anymore I can do or provide, I'd be happy to! Thank you very much!
